# Spectre demo

Code for a simple spectre demo taken from [Chandler Carruth's CppCon talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f7O3IfIR2k)

Code is for modern x64 chips circa 2018. 

I couldnt find his slides or source code online so I recreated the code from
the video.

# Running

```
$ make
$ ./cache
$ ./spectrev1
```
